# typescript-library-starter

Yet another library starter using TypeScript - this time with Mocha & Yarn. The
rest of this readme is just a template.

## Example

## Install

## Documentation

## Testing

The tests are not distributed with the npm package (to reduce its size). To run
the tests, clone this repo from github, then run the tests:

```sh
yarn install
npm test
```

Tests are located in the same directories as the source files they test to
localise knowledge and more easily identify files without tests.
